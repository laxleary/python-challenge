# Python Challenge 
*The included code was entirely designed by myself, with nothing directly copied from any other sources. Outside sources were used to identify commands or command syntax in the following ways:* 

- Google research was used to remind myself how to create folders in GitHub (We then reviewed this in class the next day, but I used Google first). 
  
- I Checked the proper "not in" syntax with Google, as my original code included the word "is" and would not run. 

- As I needed to put a block of code including a for loop in the middle of my text, I needed a way to write into a .txt file without overwriting the previous contents. I was able to find the append mode of opening a file, "a", by doing some more research on Google. 

As usual, I referred to our class activities while completing the assignment, but none of my code came from tutors, other students, instructors, or TAs for this assignment.
