# Python Challenge 
*The included code was entirely designed by myself, with the only directly copied blocks being from previous in-class activities. Outside sources were used to identify functions or code syntax in the following ways:* 

- Google research was used to remind myself how to create folders in GitHub (We then reviewed this in class the next day, but I used Google first). 
  
- I checked the proper "not in" syntax with Microsoft Bing, as my original code included the word "is" and would not run. The result I received was composed by Microsoft Bing from DelfStack and W3Docs.

- As I needed to put a block of code including a for loop in the middle of my text, I needed a way to write into a .txt file without overwriting the previous contents. I was able to find the append mode of opening a file, "a", by doing some more research on Google, which ended with me using the site GeeksforGeeks.

- I copied the first few lines of code off of our CSV Read/Write Activity and then changed the variables/file paths appropriately. 

On this particular assignment, I did not receive any assistance from tutors, other students, instructors, or TAs.
